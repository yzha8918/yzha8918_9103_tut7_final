/**
 * This script creates an interactive artwork inspired by Pacita Abad's "Wheels of Fortune."
 * It generates a dynamic arrangement of interconnected wheels with vibrant color palettes.
 *
 * The artwork features:
 * - Procedurally generated wheels with varied sizes and positions, allowing for slight overlaps.
 * - Decorative connectors between nearby wheels, mimicking a chain-like appearance.
 * - Interactive elements:
 * - Clicking a wheel triggers a "dandelion" effect, dispersing its internal elements (spokes and outer dots)
 * and those of other wheels sharing the same base color.
 * - Pressing the spacebar triggers a "rewind" effect, bringing the dispersed particles back to their
 * original wheels, and gradually fading in the wheels' internal patterns.
 *
 * The "dandelion" and "rewind" functionalities are implemented using a particle system and state management
 * within the Wheel and DandelionParticle classes.
