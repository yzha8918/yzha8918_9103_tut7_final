## Instructions on how to interact with the work
Once the page loads, tap the ‘Play/Pause’ button at the bottom of the screen to play or pause the music. Once the music starts, the wheel bounces and scales with the audio spectrum, creating a dynamic visual rhythm.

## Details of my individual approach to animating the group code
1. I choose audio to drive my individual code
2. In my piece, unlike the group the size of the wheel changes with the FFT of the music.
3. I mainly referenced week12's tutorial, and I think that fate itself is varied and changes all the time, so that triggered my adaptation of this piece to have the Wheel of Fortune change according to the music!
4. I had load a sound file from disk and It comes from Freesound[Link Text](https://freesound.org/people/RokZRooM/sounds/613323/). I initially searched for the keyword *FORTUNE* in Freesound and looked for works by that author *PLIGHT OF FORTUNE*. But I thought the music was too upbeat so I found music in that author's library that I thought fit better.
